# Sentiment Analysis of User Experiences

Under this project, sentiment analysis is employed on the textual data of user experiences. In this work, UX of a fashion recommender system was conducted considering three main themes i.e. Interface, Functionality, and Accomplishments. To achieve this goal, a set of surveys were conducted containing open-ended questions. The answers of questions were analysed regarding the sentiments.

The sentiment analysis was performed using pre-trained LLM "**TimeLMs**" (https://github.com/cardiffnlp/timelms?tab=readme-ov-file)

These analyses were conducted in a set of experimental settings:
1) Stakeholder-level sentiment analysis was performed to collect UX feedbacks regarding positive, negative, and neutral sentiments.
2) Different user profiles (considering age, gender, hobbies, and chatbot experties) were examined regarding their sentiments about system use.
3) Statistical analyses were conducted to evaluate the sentiments differences among different user profile groups.
